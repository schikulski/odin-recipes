    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. To prepare the meat sauce, brown ground beef or Italian sausage in a skillet with diced onions and minced garlic. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian seasoning, then let it simmer until thickened. Meanwhile, mix ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper to create a smooth and flavorful filling. Boil lasagna noodles until al dente, then drain and set them aside. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a baking dish to prevent sticking.</p>
    <p>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish, followed by a layer of noodles. Add a layer of the ricotta mixture, sprinkle shredded mozzarella, and repeat the layers until the dish is filled. Finish with a final layer of noodles, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese on top. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until bubbly and golden brown. Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing, ensuring the layers stay intact. Serve with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a complete, hearty meal.</p>
